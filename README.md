This is an app to save your movies. You can create lists to save your watched movies, want to see movies, movies to never watch. <br>

I got lost adding too many folders and trying to add stuff to index.html AND index.ejs. I went back through all the code and now have my login page back up and running. I can now proceed with a user profile. <br>
I set up the code for mocha/chai tests, but have not tested them yet. <br>
I have a post route working. I am know going to get it to render better on the page, because it's just json right now and a user may not know how or want to read that. <br>
A user can search for a movie and get the information back about that movie. The data is in still in JSON view...on to phase II. <br>
I added a little bit of css and bootstrap to fix the columns and search bar length. I didn't want to add too much color; simple is better than overdone...in my view. So little color, but it works.
